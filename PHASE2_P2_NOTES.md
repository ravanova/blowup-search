# Phase-2 P2 working notes — the lottery-ticket leg (1D Hou–Luo singular profiles)

Status as of 2026-07-25. Newest context on top. This is the working doc; the banked
record is writeup/TECHNICAL_P2_HL_ANCHOR.md + BLOG_P2_HL_ANCHOR.md + fig12 (rebuilds from
committed writeup/data/p2_hl_anchor.json via `python writeup/p2_hl_anchor_evidence.py`).

## TOP STATUS — validation anchor DONE; novelty leg NOT yet started

After Spike 1 (the 2D Boussinesq dynamic-rescaling machine, which reproduced the *proven*
Chen–Hou regular profile), we scoped P2 = the actual novelty frontier. Decision (with the
user, from evidence): **attack the 1D Hou–Luo (HL) model, not 2D Boussinesq.**

Target paper: **Chen–Huang–Li, arXiv:2604.01868** (Papers/, gitignored — `Read` page by page).
Their novel result: *degenerate* initial data (ω⁰ₓ(0)=θ⁰ₓₓ(0)=0) develops **singular**
self-similar profiles via a **two-stage** L^∞-then-L^p blowup. This is a **not-rigorously-proven
frontier** — only *weak existence* of the explicit profile is proven (their Thm 2.3); the
*asymptotic stability* (that generic degenerate data converges to it) is **numerical only**.
That gap is where a lottery ticket could live.

### Why 1D-HL over 2D (the scout, §1)
- The novel phenomenon lives first in the 1D HL model (ωₜ+uωₓ=θₓ, θₜ+uθₓ=0, uₓ=H(ω)),
  which "models the boundary behaviour of the Hou–Luo / 3D-axisymmetric-Euler scenario."
- 1D reuses machinery we already have (solver/line_hilbert.py 6/6, gclm rescaling 5/5).
- 2D would compound the exact far-field-tail problem Spike-1 Step C already hit, at higher cost.
- **Feasibility probe (decisive):** our line-Hilbert operator **survives** the singular profile.
  Against the exact H I derived (below), the (X−1)^{−1/2} *core* is representable to a few %
  and improving; the only real error is the slow X^{−1/2} *tail*, which is **truncation-limited**
  (halves with domain reach M, immune to node clustering) — the known semi-analytic-outer-patch
  gap, NOT a failure to resolve the singularity. (fig12 panel C.)

## §2 — The validation anchor (DONE, 2026-07-25). VALIDATION, not novelty.

Rescaled HL dynamics (their (2.4)), fields Ω (vorticity), Θ (buoyancy), velocity U:
```
Ω_τ + (U + c_l X) Ω_X = c_ω Ω + Θ_X
Θ_τ + (U + c_l X) Θ_X = (c_l + 2 c_ω) Θ
U_X = H(Ω),  U(0)=0.
```
Two genuinely new pieces vs the CLM solver: the velocity U is the *integral* of H(Ω) pinned at
U(0)=0 (CLM's transport speed was purely algebraic), and the second buoyancy field Θ.

**Explicit exact anchor — their Theorem 2.3:**
```
Ω̄(X) = (X−1)^{−1/2} 1_{X>1},   Θ̄ = (π/2) 1_{X>1},   c̄_l = 2,  c̄_ω = −1.
```
**Derived here (a small self-contained result):** from the classical Hilbert pair
H(x₊^{−1/2}) = −(−x)₊^{−1/2} (Fourier multiplier −i·sgn(ξ)),
```
H(Ω̄)(X) = −(1−X)^{−1/2} 1_{X<1},    U̅(X) = 2√(1−X) − 2  (X<1),  −2  (X≥1),
```
which satisfies (U̅+2X)Ω̄_X + Ω̄ = 0 on X>1 (the strong steady form; Remark 5.4) and U̅(0)=0,
U̅(1⁻)=−2. A free consistency check: c̄_l+2c̄_ω = 0 exactly ⇒ the Θ steady equation is trivial.

**Built:** solver/hl_rescaled.py (velocity operator, rescaled RHS, steady residual, both grids).
**Tests:** test_hl_rescaled.py **5/5** —
- velocity operator vs analytic arctan(2X): 1.1e−5; full pipeline through the dense H: 1.8e−3
- velocity on the singular anchor → U̅, converges under δ-refinement (½-order — the √-singularity)
- steady residual of the explicit Thm 2.3 profile → 6.2e−3, converging
- c̄_l+2c̄_ω=0 consistency: exactly 0.

## §3 — Performance (line_hilbert.py, the shared operator)
The build bottleneck was in the shared operator, not the new P2 code:
- batched Thomas solve for the slope operator: `_slope_matrix` 6.15s → 0.29s (21×);
- Horner + shared + shortened `L(s)` series (dominant cost): n=4001 matrix build 65s → 19.7s (3.3×);
- lazy Hilbert matrix in RescaledHL (anchors that use exact H never build it).
Net: HL suite >120s → 3.9s. Accuracy **identical** (line_hilbert 6/6, gclm 5/5, hl 5/5 all green).

## §4 — THE OPEN WORK (the actual lottery ticket; NOT yet started)
The anchor above reproduces a *proven* result — it validates the singular machinery, nothing more
(Tier-1/2, not novel, not a proof; same category as Spike 1). Novelty begins with the **dynamic
relaxation + degenerate-case normalization**:
- Build the SSPRK3 time stepper for (2.4) with a normalization that works when the origin slopes
  vanish (CHH22's origin-slope gauge is degenerate for degenerate data — need a higher-order or
  norm-based gauge). LOCK a predicate BEFORE the logged run.
- **Novelty target:** does *generic smooth degenerate data* converge to the singular profile (the
  asymptotic stability CHL only asserted)? A resolution-confirmed yes/no is a Tier-2-style
  contribution. Beyond that: unexplored degeneracy orders / profile families; the flagged-open
  link to Hou–Huang two-scale 3D-axisymmetric-Euler (HH23).
- The slow X^{−1/2} tail will need a fixed-τ protocol + semi-analytic r^α outer patch (same fix
  flagged for Spike-1 Step-C polish). Bounded, known.

Honest odds unchanged: overall Clay ~0.05%. The realistic prize is novel toy-model singularity
research + a shareable, data-backed writeup. This leg is the first genuine swing at it.
