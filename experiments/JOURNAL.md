# Experiment Journal

Hand-written context per experiment (see LOGGING.md — the structured logs
answer "what happened"; this records *why* and what a human noticed).

## stage2-shakedown (d47b579) — 2026-07-22

Why configured this way: first end-to-end run of the Stage 2 GA harness —
deliberately tiny (pop 6, 3 generations, seed 999) to shake out the
pipeline before the real 3-seed acceptance runs, per PLAN.md. Full frozen
fitness config (N=256, t_max=12, bisection [0, 0.1] tol 1e-3, v2 oracle).

What a human noticed skimming the results:

- The literature positive control lands where Stage 1.5 put it: sin(x)
  0.0535 (vs 0.0527 at the coarser Stage 1.5 tolerance), sin(2x) 0.0137
  exactly, and bump(κ=5) censored "low" — the beyond-horizon control
  behaves inside the GA harness too.
- Warm-started child evaluations took a median 9 solver runs vs 11 cold,
  with 0 bracket expansions in 12 — the ±0.01 margin is, if anything,
  generous; leaving it.
- Median 15.3s per evaluation, ~2× the Stage 1.5 per-bisection cost:
  the [0, 0.1] range concentrates bisection samples near the critical
  value, where no-blow-up runs burn the whole t_max. Real-run sizing
  (~25 min/seed at 10 workers) accounts for it.
- A random init genome (0.0543) edged out sin(x) immediately — the
  landscape above 0.053 is reachable, but the random baseline found it
  too. Whether the GA can *separate* from the baseline is exactly what
  the 3-seed acceptance runs measure.

## stage1_5_sweep (v1: 5c6dfc2, v2: b05b9bf) — 2026-07-22

Why configured this way: t_max=12 chosen after computing analytic CLM T*
for all 20 normalized ICs (live shapes span 1.0–6.5; bump(κ=5) at 15.9 kept
deliberately as a beyond-horizon censoring control). ν bisected at a=0 to
isolate viscosity in the proven-blow-up regime; a bisected at ν=0. One
energy scale (E of sin(x)) across all shapes so critical values compare
shape, not amplitude.

What a human noticed skimming the results:

- The ν axis is astonishingly clean: all 80 v1-vs-v2 and 256-vs-512
  ν-bisections take *identical* decision paths. The sin(2x) value landing at
  ν_crit(sin)/4 (νk² scaling) was not designed in — good sign the number is
  physical.
- The v1 a-axis anomalies (censored-high at N=512 only, for two shapes) all
  traced to one predicate flaw: accepting held-out-R²≈0.9 fits whose
  extrapolated T* was 6–11× beyond the horizon. Capping T* at 1.5·t_max
  (v2) fixed every one; tail(p=1)'s 2× resolution drift survived the fix
  and is the real, physical reason a_crit was rejected.
- 14% of amplification-stopped runs had tail fits below the R² floor
  (bursty near-critical growth) — the amplification-first predicate rule
  mattered in practice, not just in principle.
- Energy-balance residuals up to 0.5 on ν-axis blow-up runs looked alarming
  but are endgame dt-integration error: halving dt halves them and moves
  ν_crit by exactly zero (3-shape spot-check at N=512).
